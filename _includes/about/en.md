HiHi, I'm Chen Lihan (also known as Chen Lihan, Paida Xing, Dalang, Chen Dao), a broken photographer, an undergraduate student majoring in electronics and computer engineering, and a [RMer](https://www.robomaster.com/) who is barbarically growing in the algorithm team of [SMBU](https://www.smbu.edu.cn/) [Porlarbear](https://g.h5gdsvip.com/p/lftipqki).

Not a big shot, just a Ctrl_CV package thief. Currently, I'm relatively good at navigation and decision trees, with the following open-source projects:

- [pb_rm_simulation](https://gitee.com/SMBU-POLARBEAR/pb_rmsimulation)

    Implementation of the "sim2real" Robomaster Sentinel navigation package.

- [rm_behavior_tree](https://gitee.com/SMBU-POLARBEAR/rm_behavior_tree)

    Robomaster Sentinel robot decision tree. After writing simple execution nodes, edit the decision tree through Groot2 for visualization, and finally combine complex behavior logic. (It's actually a giant if-else, but the advantage is strong readability)

Feel free to reach out to me for discussions~

Currently, my physical activities are mainly in Deep North, and I also want to be a digital game <del>man</del> hero (high-intensity surfing player). My virtual avatar is often seen on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/170786212), [QQ](https://qm.qq.com/q/Y3gFHS6eEc), etc., with the same name across the internet, but most of the time, I'm just an audience.
